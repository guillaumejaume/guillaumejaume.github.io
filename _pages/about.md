<!-- postdoc + phd -->
I am a postdoctoral researcher at **Harvard Medical School** and Brigham and Women's Hospital in the [Mahmood Lab](https://faisal.ai/) (since May 2022). I hold a PhD in electrical engineering and computer science from the [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edee-electrical-engineering/), obtained in collaboration with [IBM Research -- Europe](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/) and [ETH -- Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) under the supervision of [Jean-Philippe Thiran](https://people.epfl.ch/jean-philippe.thiran) and [Maria Gabrani](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=zurich-mga).  

<!-- research -->
 My research focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools into the clinical and research aspects of pathology with two primary objectives: (1) advancing **representation learning of tissue** by developing large-scale generic-purpose foundation models for histology, and (2) incorporating AI tools in  **drug development** for better drug safety assessment, toxicity detection, and safety biomarker discovery.

<!-- My research focuses on computational pathology, for the development of scalable, explainable and annotation-efficient computer-aided diagnosis tools and the discovery of novel biomarkers. My main contribution is to have explored the paradgim of graphs for modeling histology images, by representing biological entities, (*e.g.,* nuclei, tissue regions) as nodes, entity-entity interactions as edges. I am also the main contributor of [HistoCartography](https://github.com/histocartography/histocartography), a Python library to ease the development of computational pathology and graph analytics tools.  -->

<!-- impact -->
<!-- I have published in top-tier computer vision and machine learning conferences (e.g., [CVPR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12646.pdf), [MICCAI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03129.pdf)), and journals (*e.g.,* [Medical Image Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841521003091)), with numerous Best Paper Awards obtained in conference workshops (*e.g.,* [ICML workshop in Computational Biology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00311.pdf)).  -->

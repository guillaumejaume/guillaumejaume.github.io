<!-- postdoc + phd -->
I am a third-year postdoctoral researcher at **Harvard Medical School** and **Brigham and Women's Hospital** in the [Mahmood Lab](https://faisal.ai/) (since May 2022). I hold a PhD in electrical engineering and computer science from the [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edee-electrical-engineering/), obtained in collaboration with [IBM Research -- Europe](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/) and [ETH -- Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) under the supervision of [Jean-Philippe Thiran](https://people.epfl.ch/jean-philippe.thiran) and [Maria Gabrani](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=zurich-mga).  

<!-- research -->
My research aims to answer *How can we develop actionable and transferable AI models for pathology?*, and *How can we leverage these models for diagnosis, prognosis, and biomarker discovery?*. Over the past six years, I have created foundation models, established new benchmarks, contributed to several open-source projects, and developed applications for pathology that have gained significant recognition in leading journals (such as Nature Medicine and Cell) and prominent AI/ML conferences (such as NeurIPS, CVPR or ECCV).

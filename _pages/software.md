As a researcher, I strive to make access to science and research as easy as possible for everyone. Open science in applied machine learning research involves open-sourcing code to ensure reproducibility and transparency of new methods, as well as publishing datasets for robust comparative analysis. 

-   **HistoCartography**: A collection of image-to-graph translation and
    state-of-the-art graph algorithms for facilitating interpretable
    entity-based analysis in digital pathology
    \[[Code](https://github.com/histocartography/histocartography)\]

-   **BR**e**A**st **C**arcinoma **S**ubtyping (**BRACS**): A large
    cohort of H&E stained histopathological images for automated breast
    cancer diagnosis \[[Website](https://www.bracs.icar.cnr.it/)\]

-   **FUNSD**: A dataset for Form Understanding in Noisy Scanned
    Documents \[[Website](https://guillaumejaume.github.io/FUNSD/)\]
